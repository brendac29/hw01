### About Me
My name is Brenda Castaneda. I am a third-year in the college and I am majoring in *Public Policy* and *Latin American and Caribbean Studies*. Some of my policy interest areas are education, immigration, and foreign policy. 

### Interest in this course
I am taking this course to satisfy the Methods requirement for the Public policy major. I took [Social Science Inquiry](http://collegecatalog.uchicago.edu/search/?P=SOSC%2013100-13200-13300) last year and was introduced to social science research tools and data analysis using R. Computing for the social sciences was recommended to me by a friend and I am looking forward to brushing up on and expanding upon what I learned in SSI last year.  

### Quaratine Activities
I am currently in Chicago but spent my summer in quarantine at home in Dallas. Here's a list of some of the things I did to make life a little less boring:

* taking long walks by the lake shore
* baking
* painting/DIY projects
